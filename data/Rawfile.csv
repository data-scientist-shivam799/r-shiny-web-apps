We are all connected by the beautiful gift of language and receive a sound foundation in our school years. Moreover, effective communication allows an individual both to understand and to be understood! It is hence instrumental in the successful completion of many tasks both academic and otherwise. Another skill one must pursue with sincere dedication is teamwork. Teamwork is a skill that must be drilled into young minds at an early age. Teamwork encompasses so many virtues such as mutual respect, hard work, equality that are life lessons. For example, A child working on a project in a group is bound to learn how to strategize and work well so that the outcome of the group is superlative, he also learns respect for each individual's ideas, creativity, time and effort. Moreover it teaches dedication and paves the path for excellence in future endeavors. ","As a teacher I would definitely recommend teacher training sessions in their respective subjects. Very often teachers tend to get very complacent and assume they have learnt all there is to know! I beg to differ on this notion as I believe that there is always room for improvement, and as long as we are working on ourselves we can achieve our full potential. It is also true that constant up-gradation is a must in the educational field or you soon become redundant. Since we are with young minds, it is imperative that we soak in every bit of information there is with regards to our subjects so that the students do not feel shortchanged or resort to the internet alone as their source of information. Therefore, as teachers, annual training in the subject you teach  is necessary to keep abreast with current trends, to learn new techniques on how to transfer the information/knowledge you have, or to simply revise the concepts we already know.

A sound and effective communication is possible only when one listens intently to what is spoken. Hence, a student needs to develop the skill of listening. For example, a student who does not pay attention to instructions given in class will not be able to carry out an activity effectively, as opposed to a student who pays careful attention to what is been spoken. Secondly, a student needs to learn how to converse with another with a smooth flow of thought.For example, a student performing in an Impromptu competition, will need to learn how to gather his/her thoughts, before saying something to the audience. Hence, speaking skills should also be developed in a student as it enables a child to be more confident and ensures smooth communication which will benefit the student as he prepares for life.","Campion provides an excellent ground for new learning. Keeping this in mind, I would like class room teaching to be an out of the box experience, where children learn amidst nature rather than being confined to the four walls of the classroom.  Students generally long to be outdoors and given the nature of our curriculum, there are a lot of activities that can be conducted for students. Also, community learning can be elaborated upon where Campion students can be made to experience learning with the less privileged children. This will create sensitivity among students who will learn to be more appreciative of the benefits they possess. Besides this, I would also like to bring in training sessions for teachers on values and compassion as there is a growing need for such sessions to keep individuals firmly rooted to the ground and be sensitive towards   the children we teach.
